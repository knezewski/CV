# Andrei Kniazev
I'm a web-developer.

I enjoy building digital products that either solve problems or entertain people. Preferrably in Javascript.

I'm self driven, hard working and easy going. I also hold a master degree in biology.

## Experience:

In early 2015 I enrolled as a student at LoftSchool. LoftSchool is a 6 month intensive coding course with a focus on Javascript. After graduation, I've worked with commercial clients, mostly building MVP's for startups.


## Projects I've coded:
### Keyword King
A webapp that instantly shows you your app's underperforming keywords in the App Store.

### Squish
A service for students to help them remember and repeat their notes.
